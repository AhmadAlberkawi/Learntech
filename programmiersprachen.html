		var i2=`Java is another popular choice in large organizations and it has remained so for decades. 
		Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale web applications. Java is known to be extremely stable and so, 
		many large enterprises have adopted it. If you are looking for a development based job at a large organization, 
		Java is the language that you should learn.
		Java is also widely used in Android App Development. Almost any business today needs an Android Application owing to the fact that there are billions of Android users today. 
		This opens up a huge opportunity for Java developers given the fact that Google has created an excellent Java-based Android development framework – Android Studio.`;
		
		var i3 =`C/C++ is like the bread and butter of programming. Almost all low-level systems such as operating systems,
		file systems, etc are written in C/C++. If you wish to be a system-level programmer, C/C++ is the language you should learn.
		C++ is also widely used by competitive programmers owing to the fact that it is extremely fast and stable.
		C++ also provides something called as STL – Standard Template Library. STL is a pool of ready-to-use libraries for various data structures, 
		arithmetic operations, and algorithms. The library support and speed of the language make it a popular choice in the High-frequency trading community as well.`;
		
		var i4 =`JavaScript is the “frontend” programming language. JavaScript is widely used to design interactive frontend applications.
		For instance, when you click on a button which opens up a popup, the logic is implemented via JavaScript.
		These days, many organizations, particularly startups, are using NodeJS which is a JavaScript-based run-time environment. 
		Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser. 
		Hence now with JS, you can use a single programming language for server side and client side scripts. 
		If you are looking for that cool tech job at your favorite startup, you should seriously consider learning JavaScript.`;
		
		var i5=`Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language built by Google.
		Go provides excellent support for multithreading and so, 
		it is being used by a lot of companies that rely heavily on distributed systems. 
		Go is widely used in startups in Silicon Valley. However, it is yet to be adopted by Indian companies/startups. 
		Those who wish to join a Valley-based startup specializing in core systems should master Golang.`;
		
		var i6 =`R programming language is one of the most commonly used programming languages for Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 
		R provides an excellent framework and built-in libraries to develop powerful Machine Learning algorithms. 
		R is also used for general statistical computing as well as graphics. R has been well adopted by enterprises. 
		Those who wish to join “Analytics” team of a large organization should definitely learn R.`;
		
		var i7=`PHP is among the most popular backend programming language. 
				Though PHP is facing a tough competition from Python and JavaScript, the market still needs a large number of PHP developers.
				Those who wish to join a reasonably well old organization as a backend developer should aim to learn PHP programming.`;
